In this project, I wanted to look at how often an NBA finals series went to game 7, game 6...etc.
I used data available from basketball-reference.com and used pandas to read and manipulate the csv file. 
I only looked at the years 1950 to 2016. \n\n


Results:\n\n

Percent of 4-game NBA finals series: 10.5% \n
Percent of 5-game NBA finals series: 25.0% \n
Percent of 6-game NBA finals series: 35.5% \n
Percent of 7-game NBA finals series: 28.9% \n

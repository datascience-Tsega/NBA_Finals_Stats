In this project, I wanted to look at how often an NBA finals series went to game 7, game 6...etc.
I used data available from basketball-reference.com and used pandas to read and manipulate the csv file. 
I only looked at the years 1950 to 2016. 


Results:

NBA finals series went to 4-games, 10.5% of the time

NBA finals series went to 5-games, 25.0% of the time

NBA finals series went to 6-games, 35.5% of the time

NBA finals series went to 7-games, 28.9% of the time
